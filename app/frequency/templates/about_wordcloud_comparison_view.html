This vizualization helps you find the most important words in the <span class="first-query
">main</span>, <span class="second-query">comparison</span>, and combined queries.  
</p>
<p>
The left and right columns show the top 100 words from the <span class="first-query
">main</span> and <span class="second-query">comparison</span> queries.  Words the two have in common only show up in the center column.  Each column is normalized independently to the (currently, estimated) total number of unique words in the query.
</p>
<p>
Columns are normalized independently, so this is not helpful for figuring out how large one query is versus another, or how skewed a word is towards one query of the other.

Click a word to run a query with the same sources and dates, but for that word.
